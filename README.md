# Careers

Continuum Trading is a proprietary trading firm with a focus on market making
and statistical arbitrage. We make our money by having better technology &
models than the next team.

## Culture

- Meritocracy: We value ideas above rank or politics.
- Compassion: Only those without original thoughts are never wrong.
- Improvement: Making mistakes can often be the fastest way to learn.

## Management Style

We don't have people that only manage people, everyone is an expert in a
particular area and contributes to the combined understanding. You are expected
to teach your fellow colleague. In return you can expect to learn from that same
colleague.

Priorities are set & projects are assigned but large amounts of autonomy in
implementation is afforded. At the same time, you are expected to use the PR
process to learn company standards. If the standards are wrong you are expected
to contribute the correction back to the shared knowledge.

## Individual Traits

- Responsibility
  - If you are missing information, raise a question.
  - If you're stuck, take active measures to get unstuck. Multiple brains are,
    generally, better than one.
- Truth seeking
  - You must be more interested in pursuing perfect knowledge than pushing your
    preconceptions.
  - Arguing in bad faith or without the willingness to change your mind is
    negative EV.
  - Experience is not a substitute for mental plasticity.
- Relaxed & confident
  - This domain can at times be high stress, though this can generally be
    minimized with competence & preparation.
  - Not being asleep at the wheel is good but being in a state of constant alarm
    will lead to burnout & operator error.

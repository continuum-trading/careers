# Rust Engineer

A power user of the rust language.

Currently, the team has moderate competence in the Rust language. We're looking
for someone who considers themselves well versed in all the many features of
Rust. This means you've ideally built libraries that have required you to
operate at the bleeding edge of the language, you've yearned for features that
exist only in RFCs or nightly rust.

## Core Tasks

- Raise the company's understanding of Rust.

## Side Tasks

- Solve challenging logic/mathematical/game theory problems.
- Contribute to the company's software/trading architecture.

## Location

- No location requirement.
